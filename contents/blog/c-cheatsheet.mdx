Hello, buddies! I recently discovered the power of cheat sheets and thought of making a cheat sheet for C++, which has a myth as "too hard."üòû Any language, even Python can be hard of you didn't try.

C++, an extension of C‚Äîwhich we said was an easy language to learn ‚Äîis a general-purpose programming language. Google Chromium browser, several Microsoft applications, and even financial modeling at Morgan Stanley are said to be done with C++.

If you say it is hard, it is only for 3 reasons.

- It has complex syntax to support versatility
- It is a permissive language‚Äîyou can do everything that‚Äôs technically possible, even if not logically right
- It is best learned by someone who already has a foundation with C programming

# Introduction

## What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.

C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.

How C++ is Used? C++ is used for all kinds of applications from computer games to OS and compilers. This programming language adds onto C Programming language and includes modern programming C++ is so compatible with C that it can compile more than 99% of the C programs without changing even a single source code Anything that computers can physically perform from manipulating numbers to text can be programmed using C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

Let's break up the code to understand it better:

- Line 1 - `#include <iostream>` is is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
- Line 2 - `using namespace std` means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

Don't worry about these. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.

- Line 3 - Blank line. C++ don't care about spaces.
- Line 4 - Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

- Line 5 - `cout` (Pronunciation - "see out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (&gt;&gt;) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World". It's easy to remember this from pronunciation "see out".
- Line 6 - `return 0` ends the main function.

‚ö†Ô∏èThings to note:

- Every line in C++ is ending with semicolon `;`.
- Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket `}` to actually end the main function.

- Comments in C++ can be single or multi-line and start with `/*` and close with `*/`.
- Comments can also start with `//`, extending to the lines end.

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- `double` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- `string` - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes

A variable in C++ must be a specified data type

```cpp
int myNum = 12; // Integer (whole number without decimals)
string name = "Unity Buddy"; // String(text)
char myLetter = 'U'; //character
float myFloatNum = 5.99; // Floating point number (with decimals)
```

We have already learnt about `cout` which is used for Show Output. So for take **user input**, we use opposite side, `cin`, it means "See In". See out and See In, It's easy! Let's take an example.

```cpp
int x;  // making a variable called x.
cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter
cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
cout << "Your number is: " << x; // Display the input value
```

‚ö†Ô∏èRemember,

- cout is used to show Output and uses the insertion operator `(&gt;&gt;)`
- cin is used to get User Input and uses the extraction operator `(&lt;&lt;)`

- A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

  ```cpp
  string myName = "John Doe";
  ```

  To use strings, you must import <string> library.

  ```cpp
  #include <string>
  ```

String Concatenation

To combine two strings, we use `+` sign.

```cpp
string myName = "John";
string myLastName = "Doe";
string myFullName = myName + " " + myLastName;
cout << myFullName;
```
